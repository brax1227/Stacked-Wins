## User Journey: Day 1 → Day 30

### Phase 0 — First Open (0–90 seconds)

**User Emotion:** Guarded, curious, slightly skeptical  
**User Decision:** "Is this safe? Is this cringe? Will it overwhelm me?"

**UI Elements:**
- Minimal intro: **"Stacked Wins"** + 2-line value statement
- Privacy-first reassurance: "Your data stays private. You control what you share."
- CTA: **Start Assessment** (primary), **Explore First** (secondary)

**Coaching Interaction:**
- One calm line: **"We'll start small. You'll never be asked to 'fix everything' today."**

**Progress Moment:**
- Micro-win: "Completed first step: opened and started."

---

### Phase 1 — Onboarding Deep Assessment (6–10 minutes, skippable chunks)

**User Emotion:** Relief if structured; fatigue if too long  
**User Decisions:**
- How honest to be
- What tone they want (firm vs gentle)
- What "success" means to them (identity + outcomes)

**UI Elements:**
- Stepper with time estimate: **"6–10 min • can pause anytime"**
- Sections (cards):
  - Baseline (mental health, stress, anxiety)
  - Sleep & Energy
  - Stress & Anxiety levels
  - Current Habits
  - Lifestyle & Time availability
  - Goals (long-term vision)
  - Preferred tone
  - Current struggles
  - Identity / Values
- Two sliders always visible: **Energy today** and **Stress today** (used immediately for plan sizing)

**Coaching Interaction:**
- "I'll use this to make your plan doable, not impressive."
- Optional "Why we ask this" tooltips

**Progress Moment:**
- "Assessment complete" → immediate plan generation with visible logic

---

### Phase 2 — AI Plan Generation & Acceptance (2–3 minutes)

**User Emotion:** Hopeful; testing credibility  
**User Decisions:**
- Approve suggested goals or edit
- Choose plan intensity: **Low / Standard / High** (with warnings against jumping too high)

**UI Elements:**
- **Plan Summary** with clear hierarchy:
  - Vision (6–12 months)
  - 3 Milestones (monthly)
  - This week's theme
  - Today's micro-wins (preview)
- **"Why this plan"** panel: shows reasoning in plain language
- **Guardrail toggle:** "Keep it small (recommended)" on by default

**Coaching Interaction:**
- "Your plan is built to be repeatable on rough days."

**Progress Moment:**
- "Plan accepted" → first Daily Plan created

---

### Phase 3 — Day 1 Execution (First Daily Plan Session)

**User Emotion:** Anxious about follow-through; wants a quick win  
**User Decisions:**
- Do tasks now vs later
- If they're struggling: reduce scope without shame

**UI Elements (Daily Plan Home):**
- **Today: 3–7 micro-actions** (default 3 on Day 1)
- **Total time** (e.g., 12 min)
- Progress ring + **Win counter**
- A single calm line of copy (not hype)
- Buttons: **Start**, **Adjust**, **Talk to Coach**

**Coaching Interaction (lightweight, not chatty):**
- When tapping Start: "We're aiming for completion, not intensity."
- If idle: "If you can do 2 minutes, that counts."

**Progress Moment:**
- After first completion: "Win logged" + brief reflection prompt (optional)

---

### Phase 4 — Days 2–7: Stabilization (Build the Habit of Showing Up)

**User Emotion:** Motivated some days, inconsistent others; testing forgiveness  
**Key Risks:** Perfectionism, all-or-nothing, over-scaling

**Daily User Decisions:**
- Confirm energy/stress check-in (10 seconds)
- Accept plan or **Adjust down**
- Choose a "minimum viable day"

**UI Elements:**
- Daily check-in: **Energy / Stress / Sleep quality**
- **Two plan modes:**
  - **Standard Day** (default)
  - **Minimum Day** (2–5 minutes) clearly labeled as valid
- Streak shown, but framed as "showing up streak," not "punishment"

**Coaching Interactions:**
- After completion: identity reinforcement: "You kept your word today."
- After non-completion: recovery script: "Reset isn't failure. Choose a minimum day."

**Progress Moments:**
- Day 3: "Consistency rate" begins (instead of only streak)
- Day 7: Weekly review card: "Wins stacked • Mood trend • What helped"

---

### Phase 5 — Days 8–14: Gentle Progression (Increase Meaning, Not Volume)

**User Emotion:** More confident; still vulnerable to setbacks  
**Decisions:**
- Add one slightly harder action vs keep stable
- Pick a weekly focus (theme) they believe in

**UI Elements:**
- Weekly theme check-in: "This week we focus on: Sleep discipline / Anxiety regulation / Strength routine / Purpose work…"
- "Add 1% difficulty" suggestion (opt-in)
- Milestone progress bar starts moving in visible increments

**Coaching Interactions:**
- "Here's the smallest upgrade that moves the needle."
- "If stress is high, we protect the baseline."

**Progress Moments:**
- First milestone "signal": "You've completed 40+ wins. Your baseline is changing."

---

### Phase 6 — Days 15–21: Resilience (Expect and Design for Slips)

**User Emotion:** Pride + occasional shame when missing days  
**Decisions:**
- When slipping: hide vs re-engage
- Whether to talk to Coach

**UI Elements:**
- "Recovery Plan" appears after 2 missed days:
  - "Today: 1 win. Tomorrow: 2 wins. Next day: standard."
- "What got in the way?" quick tags (sleep, work, anxiety, conflict)

**Coaching Interactions:**
- Non-judgmental diagnosis + next step:
  - "Your stress spiked. We reduce load and keep identity intact."

**Progress Moments:**
- "Recovery streak" badge (not celebratory, just validating): "You returned."

---

### Phase 7 — Days 22–30: Identity Reinforcement & Clarity (System Feels Like Theirs)

**User Emotion:** Grounded; wants proof and direction  
**Decisions:**
- Commit to next milestone
- Adjust vision with more honesty

**UI Elements:**
- Month summary:
  - Wins stacked
  - Consistency rate
  - Mood trend
  - Sleep trend (if tracked)
  - Reflections synthesis (themes)
  - Milestone delta (what moved)
- "Next 30 days" plan preview + user edits

**Coaching Interactions:**
- "Based on your data, here's what actually helped you."
- "We keep what works. We drop what doesn't."

**Progress Moments:**
- Day 30 moment: "You're not starting over. You're continuing from a higher baseline."

---

  - Consistency rate
  - Mood trend line

---

## Feature Definitions

### Goal Logic (Vision → Milestones → Weekly Focus → Daily Actions)

**Structure:**
- **Vision (6–12 months):** Identity + outcome (e.g., "steady mind, disciplined routine")
- **Milestones (monthly):** Measurable, small count (max 3 active)
- **Weekly focus:** Single theme that reduces decision fatigue
- **Daily actions:**
  - 1 **Anchor Win** (highest leverage, still small)
  - 2–6 supporting micro-wins (2–10 minutes each)
  - Always include at least one "mental steadiness" action if stress baseline is high (breath, walk, journaling prompt), but avoid "content consumption"

**Constraints:**
- Start extremely small; increase difficulty only after demonstrated consistency
- Every daily set must be finishable on a bad day via **Minimum Day**

---

### Notification Logic (Calm, Supportive, Non-Intrusive)

**Types:**
- **Prep reminder** (earlier in day): "Set up your win."
- **Start window** (user-chosen): "Time for today's 1–3 wins."
- **Reflection prompt** (evening): "Log one sentence: what mattered today?"
- **Recovery support** (after missed days): "Choose a minimum day. Keep the chain alive."

**Rules:**
- Max 2/day by default (user configurable)
- If user reports high stress: fewer notifications, softer language, smaller asks
- Never guilt framing; always offer smallest-next-step

---

### Progress Scoring (Validation Engine)

Show multiple signals to avoid streak obsession:
- **Wins stacked:** Total micro-actions completed
- **Consistency rate:** % of days with ≥1 win (primary)
- **Baseline streak:** Consecutive days with ≥1 win (secondary)
- **Milestone progress:** Measurable movement
- **Mood trend:** Simple self-report trend, not clinical claims
- **Recovery strength:** Returns after missed days

---

### Adaptive Scaling Rules (Anti-Overwhelm)

**Daily Sizing Uses:**
- Energy level
- Stress level
- Recent completion rate
- Time available

**Minimum Day Trigger:**
- High stress OR low energy OR 2 missed days → default to Minimum Day suggestion

**Scaling Up:**
- If consistency rate ≥ 70% for 7 days and stress not rising → add 1 small upgrade (not more tasks)

**Scaling Down:**
- If 3-day completion drops or stress rises → reduce scope automatically, keep anchor

---

## UX Content Tone Examples

### Onboarding Microcopy
- "Answer honestly. The plan adapts to real life."
- "We start small on purpose. Consistency beats intensity."
- "Choose your tone: steady, firm, or gentle."

### Daily Plan (Home)
- "Small wins build strong foundations."
- "One win is enough to keep momentum."
- "Do the next right thing. Keep it simple."

### Completion & Identity Reinforcement
- "You kept your word today."
- "This is how discipline is built."
- "You showed up. That counts."

### Setback & Recovery
- "No shame. Reset the plan, not your standards."
- "Minimum day: one small action. Then you're back in motion."
- "You don't need perfection—only consistency."

### Coach Tone (Short, Structured)
- "Tell me your energy (1–10) and stress (1–10). I'll size today correctly."
- "Here's the smallest version of the plan that still moves you forward."
- "We protect your baseline first. Then we build."
